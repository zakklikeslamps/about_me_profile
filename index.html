                -Yours Truly
                <br>
                Greetings, and welcome. My name is Zachariah Ryan-Francis Haug, but please, address me as just Zakk.
                I am twenty-eight years old & will be twenty-nine in just a few short weeks on February, the 8th. In
                the twenty-eight years I've spent on this earth I've seen many accomplishments & successes, and as many
                failures & disappointments. I grew up in a town called Morrisville, Pennsylvania; it is located directly
                across the Delaware river from Trenton, New Jersey and about twenty miles north of Philadelphia. As a
                child I participated in many youth athletic programs, including tee-ball, basketball, pee-wee football &
                many others until I finally discovered hockey; I found an instant love for the game & played for
                several years when, upon reaching my freshman year of high-school, was unable to participate any longer
                due to my weight-class. Simultaneously, I began learnng to play music when I was eight; I started on the
                Alto Saxophone & gradually moved up to the Tenor, then began learning other instruments such as Guitar/
                Bass, Piano, some percussion instruments such as the Bongo & Drum kit, as well as learning Vocals later
                in high-school. Through my four years of high-school I'd accomplished many endeavors in my musical
                career,
                including the horn-section-squad-leader in Marching band, earning second-chair Tenor Saxophone for the
                2010
                Bucks All-County Performance Band, attaining the rank of "Accomplished" in the Pennsylvania
                Instrumentalist
                Accredidation Program (IAP), and being a Teacher/Instructor in a musicians workshop hosted by the great
                Sonny Rollins. I graduated from Morrisville High School and attended college at both Bloomsburg
                University, to further pursue a career in music, and Bucks County Community College to study education.
                While attending Bloomsburg I studied music-recording and
                performance, as well as participating in several performance groups such as jazz band, men's choir and
                the
                Bloomsburg Husky Choir, a collection of those of us who successfully auditioned for a spot. I was also
                able
                to take up Hockey again as an intramural activity and, within a single semester, had taken the record
                for "most fights within a single season." After three years and several mental health scares, I decided
                to
                take a break from school & just work; over the next several years I'd worked many jobs in retail
                outlets,
                kitchens & the local Giant Supermarket until I'd recieved the opportunity to teach music again in 2017
                at
                Farrington's Music, and at Wood's Services in 2018. Simultaneously I had re-enrolled at Bucks to further
                study music education, but unfortunately this was short-lived as Wood's had hired me as a music teacher,
                but sadly did not have the proper funds or resources to create & coordinate a functional program.
                Between
                mid-2018 and early-2020 I trained to become a carpenter and elctrician, but eventually decided not to
                pursue this any further as the work was just too inconsistent (and the pandemic). Currently I am working
                as a delivery driver for Amazon while attending an online-course in writing code & web development.

                When the COVID pandemic struck earlier this year I was laid-off, indefinitely. During that time I got
                engaged to my now-fiance, Sam, and revisited many hobbies & activities from my youth as well as some
                new ones, including playing music, LEGO building, Online Gaming, and starting a summer-landscaping
                company consisting of myself & two friends. In the last year I've created many bold LEGO projects,
                which can be found on my <a class="andy" href="https://www.instagram.com/zakkhavokbuilds/">Instagram,</a>
                or at <a class="andy" href="https://www.andysbrickshop.com/">Andy's Brick Shop.</a> I've also begun
                training
                for competitive play in games such as Rocket League, Destiny, Modern Warfare, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
                & Pokemon: Shield, and have become known amongst the gamer-community simply as Havok. Growing up a
                musician,
                I've
                developed a deep love for many different genres & bands,
                my top-tier artists being Blink-182, Wu-Tang Clan, Grover Washington Jr, Bad Religion and Linkin Park.
                I am an avid concert attendee (or at least I will be once more when the pandemic ends) and have an
                alternate persona of Deadpool that I enjoy taking up while amongst the crowd. It makes the show more
                enjoyable for both myself & others around me, as well as the artist(s) performing; I've even gotten a
                shout-out
                from the legendary Method Man the last time Wu-Tang came to Philly. I am also a deep-lover of animals &
                nature.
                I have adopted several cats and two dogs in the last ten years alone, as well as volunteering at a local
                shelter,
                fostering litters of kittens and taking care of several colonies of stray or feral cats. Currently, my
                fiance
                & I have our pittie, Nala, as well as our two cats, Po & Zombie. As we are currently living with my
                parents in
                Morrisville due to the pandemic, we are also living with their dog and two cats, Beezus, Babie & Tazz.
                My goals for the near future, upon completing this course, include pursuing further education in web 
                development, showcasing as much of my LEGO art as possible, marrying by thirty and, hopefully, participating
                in official tournaments for Smash Bros.
