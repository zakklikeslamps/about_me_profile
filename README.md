# Zakk Ryan Haug about_me_profile

**Version 2.5**
Second Assignment: Portfolio
Building a web-site from scratch that showcases me, as an individual, in a (somewhat) professional fashion. 
Utilizing both Bootsrap css/JS and my own custom css elements, I have created a web site that gives readers/visitors 
a basic idea of who I am, what I do, my interests & talents. 
I've included a few pictures of myself, my fiance, our pets, and some LEGO projects I've built, as well as three short
clips from games I enjoy playing.
