    <h1 class="Gaming">Gaming</h1>
    <p class="p">I have been playing video games almost my entire life. I began when I was three years old, playing the original 
        "Sonic the Hedgehog," and it's respective sequels on my dad's SEGA Genesis, as well as Super Mario, Spyro the Dragon, and 
        various other games on consoles belonging to friends and family. Since then I've developed a deep love for gaming, especially
        since the pandemic hit earlier this year. Some of my favorite games & franchises include Pokemon, Sonic, Halo, Mario, Smash, 
        CoD, Destiny, Mario Kart, Legend of Zelda, Rocket League and several others.

                        Rocket League is a strange, yet glorious cross-platform game. For those unfamiliar, it is
                        essentially
                        playing soccer with a matchbox car, which makes for unique challenges & gameplay. I have been
                        playing
                        this game for about four years now and have made some absolutely insane plays. Showcased above
                        is one
                        of my personal favorites, a two-piece combo of both a save on my own goal and scoring on the
                        enemy.

                    <p style="font-family: 'Gloria Hallelujah', cursive; font-size: 20px; color: black;">
                        Destiny (and its sequel) is the brain-child of the original developers of both Halo and Call of
                        Duty, some
                        of the most popular game franchises in the world; so it goes without saying that Destiny
                        incorporates the best elements of both,
                        as well as many unique features such as elemental-based super powers, unique weapons & abilities
                        based on the players chosen class & subclass, and compelling stories that entrance the players 
                        in an experience unlike anything else. Featured here is a clip of my character getting a tripple 
                        kill, which would have been a quadrakill if I had timed my mag-change just a bit better.

                       The original Modern Warfare & it's two sequels are some of the most revered games amongst gamers of the 
                       modern era. So it goes without saying that, when Activision announced a 2019 release of a Modern
                       Warfare remake, the fanbase was ecstatic for a game that brought back beloved elements and features, 
                       wrapped up in modern development and a compelling original story. Modern Warfare had a shaky start, 
                       but in the time since its release the developers have made scrupulous efforts to fix any-and-every 
                       glitch, bug and problem within the monumental FPS. Featured here is a clip of myself holding down 
                       my team's base in the playlist "Headquarters."

    <h1 class="LEGO">LEGO</h1>
    <p class="p">As previously stated, when the pandemic hit I began indulging in LEGO building as a hobby. My interest was 
        seriously peaked in February, 2020, when the series "LEGO Masters" premiered; watching the contestants create & build 
        some of the projects that were undertaken on the show inspired me to really step my build-game up. Over the last year
        I've built up a rather impressive collection of custom MOC (My Own Creation) & official minifigures, large-scale builds, and a 
        large collection of Marvel mini and big figures. I've featured some of my favorite & best projects below, and others 
        can be found on my <a class="andy" href="instagram.com/zakkhavokbuilds">Instagram</a> or at <a class="andy"

                Gritty has become a pop-culture sensation, both locally and nationally. As a Philly boy, hockey player and 
                die-hard Philadelpha Flyers fan, I couldn't pass up buying this custom-made Gritty minifigure. It was a bit 
                pricey upon purchase, but Gritty's actions and reputation in the world continue to build appreciation & 
                value for this minifigure. </div>

                but difficult concept to successfuly incorporate into LEGO builds. It is done by "hanging" a weight of bricks
                by the base of the sculpture, with either a large chain or rope piece, and allowing the weight to pull forward just 
                enough that it creates an opposite pull-force on the small chain or rope piece that connects to the middle of 
                the sculpture. The result is an interesting effect that looks as if the sculpture is two seperate parts, with 
                the top looking as if it's floating in mid-air.</div>

    <h1 class="VW">Volunteer Work</h1>
    <p class="p">I have always had a deep love for animals and wanting to help them in any way I can. From time-to-time, I volunteer at 
        a local shelter called The Bridge Clinic in Newtown, Pennsylvania. My family and I have both fostered and adopted many kittens &
        cats, some of which can be seen below. 
    </p>
    <div class="container">

                    src="Assets/Images/Farns.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Farns">Meet Farnsworth. I found him living amongst 
                    a colony of strays I look after in a small patch of woods behind the Giant in Morrisville. Based on his 
                    incredibly friendly approach and the fact that all of the other cats wouldn't allow him near any of the 
                    food I'd put out, it was determined that he was abandoned there and needed to be rescued ASAP. We fostered
                    from late 2018 until earlier this year when we were able to find him his loving forever home.</div>
            <div class="col-lg" style="font-family: 'Gloria Hallelujah', cursive; font-size: 20px; color: black;"><img
                    src="Assets/Images/Willy_Pete_Jack.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="WPJ">Willie, Pete & Jack were one of the 
                first litters of kittens we fostered. All three were discovered living with their mother in an abandoned truck
                behind a friend's house. It took some time, but eventually all three really warmed up to us, & it was difficult 
                to have to take them to the shelter when it came time for them to go to their forever homes.</div>
            <div class="col-lg" style="font-family: 'Gloria Hallelujah', cursive; font-size: 20px; color: black;"><img
                    src="Assets/Images/Nala&Babies.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Nala & Babies">Nala was rescued by a former 
                    co-worker from the Bensalem Humane Society, but when he realized his family couldn't give her the attention
                    she needed I immediately volunteered to take her in. Over the last six years she's proven to be both a loyal
                    & loving companion, as well as an incredibly needy pain who I wouldn't trade for the world. Here she is 
                    watching over our last litter of fosters, Buttons, Flower, Fluff and Po. Of the four, Buttons, Flower & Fluff
                    have gone on to be adopted by loving families. Po, on the other hand, decided to stay here & claim our house
                    as his own. He is now my cat & has cemented his place as Nala's baby brother.</div>

                    src="Assets/Images/Zombie&Babie.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Zombie & Babs">Zombie & Babie were both abandoned, 
                    but in different scenarios. Babie was discovered in the same place as Farnsworth, around the same time; the key 
                    difference between them being Farnsworth's friendliness, as opposed to Babie being incredibly skittish, made it 
                    more difficult to catch her & bring her home for care, but eventually she learned to trust me...sort of. Zombie
                    was discovered when a local realtor & friend discovered her at a house she was selling. The house was already 
                    sold & the family had left her behind when she went outside one day, while they were packing & didn't come back 
                    until it was too late. Since then she's easily earned her place in our home, winning over everyone and earning 
                    the title "Princess Pussyfoot" from my fiance.
